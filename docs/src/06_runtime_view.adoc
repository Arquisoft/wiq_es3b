=== Login

For the login, the app shows the login view, which asks the user for his username and his password.

Then, the app does a login request to the users microservice, which redirect the user to the identity provider, which handles the authentication.

If the login is succesfully, the app shows the different options of the game.
In case the login isn't succesfully, a warning message is shown.

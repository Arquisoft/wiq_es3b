|Risk|Description
|Teamwork failures
|The distribution of tasks must be done effectively, so that if one member of the team does not perform an assigned task, it can be solved by another member.
|Version management problems
|Errors in version control can delay the project. Ignorance of the branches and their purpose can lead to code conflicts.
|Lack of time
|Not planning work well can result in difficulties meeting deadlines.
|Use of unknown technologies
|The use of languages and technologies unknown to group members can make it difficult to perform assigned tasks.
|Non-optimal design
|Poorly considered design decisions can lead to a fragile or difficult-to-scale architecture, leading to long-term maintenance issues.

=== Technical debts
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Risk|Description
|Insufficient documentation 
|A lack of clear documentation about code and architecture can make it difficult to understand and maintain code, leading to additional work.
|Lack of refactoring
|The accumulation of redundant or outdated code can hinder future modifications and improvements, increasing the technical complexity of the project.
|Poor test coverage
|The absence of adequate test coverage can result in software that is prone to bugs and vulnerabilities that go undetected during the development.
|Bug pile-up
|Failure to properly resolve known bugs during development can result in code that is more problem-prone.

=== Motivation:

The system is based in microservices architecture with three independent services, each responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality. One service is the Graphic interface, this service handles the presentation layer of a web application. Another service is tasked with managing user-related functionalities. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store and manage user data efficiently. The third service utilizes Wikidata, a free open base, to automatically generate questions.

=== Quality and/or Performance Features::

The main reason we have chosen a microservices architecture is to achieve a fast and efficient application.. The availability and efficiency of the application will be affected by Wikidata's availability, but just in the question generation moment.

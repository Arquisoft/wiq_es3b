## Cross-cutting Concepts

### Maintainability:

We designed the application in a modular way to facilitate its maintenance and task division.
We separated functions for reuse in different parts of the code, such as React components.

### Usability:

We researched user needs to design a simple and intuitive interface.
We employed a user-centered approach and followed recommended usability guidelines such as font size, interface colors, etc.

### Security:

We store only essential information with user passwords encrypted for security.
Unregistered users will not be able to access others' information.

### Testing:
Usability and functionality tests are conducted to gather feedback and create the best possible product.

### Expansions:
Various expansions to the application are proposed, such as a multiplayer version or adaptability to mobile devices.

### Data persistence and availability:
Application data is stored using MongoDB, one of the most commonly used NoSQL databases.
The application can be deployed at any time locally or in an environment such as a virtual machine.
